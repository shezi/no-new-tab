# no-new-tab
a firefox extension that stops links from opening new tabs


# why?

Look, my browser has a perfectly simple way to open a link in a new tab
_when I want it_, which is by using the middle mouse button. Yes, I happen to 
have a modern computer that has a middle mouse button. So if your _content
optimization_ thinks you need to open a new tab to keep another tab open
on _my_ computer you may, respectfully, sod off.
